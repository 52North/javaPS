## Description

### Next generation standardized web-based geo-processing.

**Interoperable processing framework for web applications/distributed workflow systems**

javaPS enables the deployment of geo-processes on the web in a standardized way. One of its main goals ist the provision of an interoperable processing framework for web applications or distributed workflow systems. It features a pluggable architecture for processes and data encodings.

javaPS implements the [OGC WPS specification, version 2.0](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-065/14-065.html).

**Features:**

* General Features
  * Full java-based Open Source implementation.
  * Pluggable framework for algorithms and XML data handling and processing frameworks
  * Built upon the [arctic-sea project](https://github.com/52North/arctic-sea)
  * Streaming de-/encoders for inputs and outputs

**Key Technologies:**

* Java
* Spring
* Arctic Sea
* OpenAPI

**Benefits**

* Abstraction of (existing) processing tools
* Support for the majority of standardized geo-data formats
* Lightweight API, following the latest state of the draft OGC API Processes standard
